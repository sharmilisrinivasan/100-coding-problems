## Trailing Zeroes in Factorial

### [Problem Statement](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/basic-programming/implementation/basics-of-implementation/practice-problems/algorithm/trailing-zeroes-in-factorial/)

Mr. Yash asks all the great programmers of the world to solve a trivial problem. He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?

Input First line of input contains an integer T number of test cases. Each test case contains an integer M (1 ≤ M ≤ 100,000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.

Output First print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.
